**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Bounty (in Bitcoin sats) offered for the implementation**
The size of the bounty is proportional to how much this matters to you. If no bounty is offered,
not even a small one, this feature will not be coded because it doesn't actually matter to you.
We prioritize feature development by its bounty size compared to how much work is required to get it done.
